           ðŸ‘‹ Hey! Iâ€™m {myName} I've recently completed my Bachelor degree in Computer Science from GTN Arts College.
           I work with both front-end and back-end technologies, which means I enjoy everything from designing clean, 
           user-friendly interfaces to making sure the logic behind them runs smoothly. <br /><br />
           I started my journey because Iâ€™m passionate about technology and problem-solving. Along the way, Iâ€™ve built projects, 
           explored responsive design, and worked on full-stack applications that focus on performance and simplicity. <br /><br />
           Iâ€™m always curious and love picking up new skillsâ€”whether itâ€™s learning the latest web frameworks, experimenting with design trends, 
           or building small side projects just for fun. My goal is simple: to create web experiences that are modern, efficient, and enjoyable for everyone. ðŸš€
